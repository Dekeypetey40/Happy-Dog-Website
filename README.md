### Testing
  - I tested to make sure the website works in the following browsers: Firefox, Chrome and Edge. 
  - I used Chrome's devtools and [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to check that the stylings respond and everything functions on all screen sizes. 
  - I tested every button and link to confirm that they work and lead where they are supposed to. 

### Bugs

- ##### Solved bugs
  - My ethos section on the homepage became unresponsive to different screen sizes.
    - I solved it by realizing I had inputted the incorrect id in my media query.
  - My background image was not appearing on my github page version of the site.
    - This was solved by inputting a relative filepath to the image.
  - My logo was underlining when it should not on all pages except the index.html. 
    - I realized I had forgotten to put an id on the a element for my sign up, gallery, and response pages. 
  - My performance on my website was not optimal.
    - I solved this by compressing all of my image files. 
  - My backgrounds on my homepage where getting cropped on the right side on mobile screens.
    - My footer was wider than the container for the rest of the page so I shrunk my footer to the same width.
